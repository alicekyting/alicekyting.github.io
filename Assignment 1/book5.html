            <h3 class="titles">
                "Foster" by Claire Keegan is a beautifully written novella that tells the story of a young girl who is sent to live with a foster family in rural Ireland during the 1980s. 
                The book explores themes of family, identity, and belonging, as the protagonist struggles to come to terms with her past and find her place in the world. <br>
                <br>
                Keegan's prose is spare but evocative, and she creates a vivid sense of time and place through her descriptions of the Irish countryside and the characters who inhabit it. 
                The relationship between the protagonist and her foster family is particularly well-drawn, with Keegan capturing the complex emotions and dynamics that come with trying to integrate into a new family and culture.<br>
                <br>
                Overall, "Foster" is a poignant and affecting work of fiction that captures the heart and soul of rural Ireland, as well as the universal struggles of growing up and finding one's place in the world. 
                It is a beautifully crafted novella that is well worth reading.
